## Introduction

To test each student's proficiency in basic R programming for data preparation and visualization, each student will use the given data and what they have learned to make the closest version of Figure 2A from the Appendix section of Deschênes et al. (2017). The original figure is shown below.

Your figure does not have to aesthetically match the original graph. For example, the graph below is considered an acceptable replica.

## Instructions

1.  Clone the repository spring-asn-6-*YourUsername* to your Posit Cloud account.

2.  Read all the CSV files inside the EPA AMPD folder into the RStudio Environment. These files contain NOx emissions data from each electricity-generating facility for each month-year. Important variables include:

    **State** - The state where the electricity-generating facility is located

    **County** - The county where the electricity-generating facility is located. Note that the same county name can appear in different states.

    **Month** - The month number in the year

    **Year** - The year number

    **NOx..tons.** - The quantity of NOx emissions from each electricity-generating facility. We can assume that NA values indicate that no NOx was emitted in that unit-month.

3.  Read the counties_nbp.csv file into the RStudio Environment. This file is a list of all counties that are used in the Deschênes et al. (2017) paper. Important variables include:

    **State** - The state where the electricity-generating facility is located

    **County** - The county where the electricity-generating facility is located. Note that the same county name can appear in different states.

    **nbp** - An indicator of whether the county is regulated by the NOx Budget Program or not.

4.  Use what you have learned, class materials and online resources to replicate the figure to the best of your ability.

Hint: To calculate summer-equivalent NOx emissions in the winter, you need to multiply total NOx emissions during the winter by 5/7.

5.  Let Thanicha or a PRM know once you have finished making the graph. To test your understanding, we will ask you to modify your script on the spot.

6.  Once your modifications are approved, you will pass the assessment. The deadline to pass the assessment is Monday April 1, 2024 at 6:00 pm.
